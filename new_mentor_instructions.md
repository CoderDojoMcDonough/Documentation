# New Mentor Instructions

CoderDojo McDonough is seeking developers of all skill levels who are interested in sharing their knowledge with local youth at CoderDojo McDonough. The time commitment required is very low since the monthly sessions only last a couple hours and little preparation is necessary on your part because we will be using resources like codecademy.com.  CoderDojo is a worldwide non-profit group founded to teach young people (ages 7-17) to code. Visit [http://coderdojo.com](http://coderdojo.com) for more information about the CoderDojo movement. 

Developers with any type of experience or even non-developers who can google and type well are welcome to serve as mentors.  

Coding sessions are held at the McDonough Public Library on the second Sunday of the month. The number of students allowed to participate each month will be based on mentor participation, so we really need your help to make CoderDojo McDonough a success!  



## Background Check
All mentors must be professionally background checked as required by CoderDojo and library policies. The background check authorization form will need to be received by the library at least two weeks before you plan to attend your first session.

Here is a link to download the background check authorization form:

The McDonough Library is providing the background checks through their relationship with the Henry County Sheriff's office. The background check authorization form must be notarized and the hard copy returned to the library's administrative secretary LaDonna Poole. The Sheriff’s office also requires us to submit a copy of the person’s driver’s license and another form of official ID like a social security card, passport, birth certificate, or bank card. If anyone is concerned about identity theft issues, the library is governed by very strict privacy laws and information submitted will not be used for any other purpose, and documents will be shredded when no longer needed. 

The McDonough library offers a free notary service Monday thru Thursday between 9-5pm.  If you would like to use the library's notary, call before coming to make sure LaDonna is available. The main number here is 678-432-5353, press 1 for library administration. Other easy options for getting your background check authorization form notarized are to use a notary service at your bank or a UPS Store.  The UPS Store offers notary services for $3 and they are open until 7pm during the week and until 5pm on Saturdays.

Please either bring the ID card copies and notarized form to LaDonna at the McDonough library or mail the copies and notarized form to:

    LaDonna Poole   
    Henry County Library System   
    1001 Florence McGarity Blvd.   
    McDonough, Georgia 30252
