# Thanks for attending CoderDojo McDonough!

CoderDojo McDonough is a free and fun place where Henry County's kids learn how to code, supported by mentors and
parents! We hope you have a great time.

Students, remember that the dojo is partly a classroom, but mostly a
playground. Ultimately, you get to decide what programming languages,
tools, and ideas you want to explore, learn, and play with. And, all of us:
mentors, other students, and parents are here to help you learn and have fun.

We want you to feel free to pursue what is interesting to you. You can
always ask a mentor about things that interest you, or any other questions you
have.

    please email info@coderdojohenry.com and we will try to make one
available for you.
  * We'll have soft drinks and water and a some snacks, but if you'd
    like to bring some other snacks to share, that would be great.  
  

## Before attending a session

See our [Web Browsers](web_browsers.md) page for suggestions regarding the web browser used during coding sessions.

Please create an account on either the [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) or [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) websites on behalf of your children. Your child will need to use the same login information for each CoderDojo session.  Children who would like to learn programming concepts with minimal typing involved should be registered for Scratch.  Other students should be registered for Codecademy.

### Downloadable resources
In case there are difficulties connecting to the internet at the
library, we will have 4 USB thumb drives available with the following resources for Mac and PC laptops.  Please feel free to download these resources yourself to speed the process if we have internet access problems during the coding session.

**Scratch**  
Download the Scratch 2 Offline Editor.  Also download the 3 file links at the bottom in the "Starter Projects and Support Materials" for Starter Projects, the Getting Started Guide, and Scratch Cards.  
<http://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/>

Look through this list of projects in the Beginners, Intermediate, or Advanced track and download any projects you are interested in.  To download the Advanced track pages, right click on the link and choose the option to "Save Link Asâ€¦".

## When you arrive

Parents and students check in at the library lobby. A mentor will sign you in and guide you to the appropriate session room. Students should get a name tag and print their first name on their name tag.

Students can join another session at any time.  Students 7 - 12 who are complete beginners are encouraged to join the Scratch group.  We encourage the parent and student to discuss and decided what session their student attends.  Talk to a mentor for advice on what session your student should attend.

## During the coding session 

Students will use online learning resources to learn at their own pace with help from fellow students and mentors.  Coding sessions will usually not include a lecture or instruction from a single mentor to all students in the room.  Within each room there will be students with varying experience levels present.  Each mentor will help and encourage a group of students.  Mentors will try to group students together based on the student's experience level.  More experienced students are also welcome to assist beginner students.  

**Team up with other students**  
Mentors will encourage students to work together in pairs or small teams. Both students will be writing coding individually while asking each other questions and tackling problems together.  Intermediate students can also practice pair programming techniques.

**Learning resources used during coding sessions or in between sessions**  
Please see our **[Learning Guide](http://www.coderdojohenry.com/learning-guide)** for resources used during the coding sessions. You should also study and practice with these great free resources on your own time.

We have several regular learning areas:

  * Scratch
  * Web Development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  * Mobile Development for Android with App Inventor
  * Explore Electronics with Arduino
  * Minecraft modding with JavaScript
 
You should start on one or more of these tracks so that you'll have good
questions and ideas for what you'd like to learn more about when you
visit the dojo in person.


## Online registraton for sessions

CoderDojo McDonough uses Meetup.com's RSVP system to reserve spaces for students at each session. Visit our website and click the "RSVP for a session" link to reserve your student's spot for a session.  You will need to RSVP separately for all sessions you want your student to attend.

Parents should only RSVP for the number of students participating and do
not include parents or guardians. This will allow us to know how many students to allow based on our number of mentors.

Due to the high level of student interest, attendees who are not registered
on [our Meetup.com site](http://meetup.com/CoderDojoMcDonough) may not be allowed to sit in a session room with a mentor. Students who are not on our RSVP list will wait in a waiting area. If the room is full
to capacity with registered students, students not on the RSVP will be allowed to either move to another dojo session with availability
or students can sit in another area of the library and work on code learning websites with minimal help from a mentor. Mentors will work to ensure that all students in the library at least have access to a text editor or Scratch and ability to view learning material.  If a session room is not full with registered students when the dojo begins around 1:30pm, dojo coordinators will begin to allow waiting students to sit in the session room.

Mentors are encouraged to lead groups with no more than 8 students.  Having a limit on the number of students per mentor makes sure that students who register are able to receive adequate attention.

## Student Profile Form

We encourage all students to register using our CoderDojo Student Profile form at <http://www.coderdojohenry.com/StudentProfileForm>.  Student Profiles allow coordinators to match students with team members and mentors. All students must still RSVP for each session.  The Advanced Student Signup form has been renamed to the CoderDojo Student Profile, so if your student has already completed the Advanced Student Signup form they do not need to complete the form again. 


# Have fun and learn a lot! Let us know how we're doing too!

We want you to have fun and learn lots of new things! We also love your
feedback and want to know what kinds of ideas you have and what you want
to learn, so let us know when you visit! Thanks!
