# Thanks for attending CoderDojo McDonough!

CoderDojo McDonough is a free and fun place where Henry County's kids learn how to code, supported by mentors and
parents! We hope you have a great time.

Students, remember that the dojo is partly a classroom, but mostly a
playground. Ultimately, you get to decide what programming languages,
tools, and ideas you want to explore, learn, and play with. And, all of us:
mentors, other students, and parents are here to help you learn and have fun.

We want you to feel free to pursue what is interesting to you. You can
always ask a mentor about things that interest you, or any other questions you
have.

Library](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1001+Florence+Mcgarity+Blvd/)

## What to bring

  * Bring a laptop for your child. If you do not have access to a laptop
    please email info@coderdojohenry.com and we will try to make one
available for you.
  * We'll have soft drinks and water and a some snacks, but if you'd
    like to bring some other snacks to share, that would be great.  
  

## Before attending a session

Please create an account on either the [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) or [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) websites on behalf of your children. Your child will need to use the same login information for each CoderDojo session.  Children who would like to learn programming concepts with minimal typing involved should be registered for Scratch.  Other students should be registered for Codecademy.

In case there are difficulties connecting to the internet at the
library, please have the following software installed on the student's laptop
before they come. Thumb drives will be available with the necessary software if you are unable to install the software before the
session.

**Scratch students:** install Scratch from
[http://scratch.mit.edu](http://scratch.mit.edu)

**JavaScript and HTML/CSS students:** install the free editor Brackets
from [http://brackets.io/](http://brackets.io/) or
another popular code editor like Sublime Text 2.


## When you arrive

Parents and students check in at the library lobby. A mentor will sign you in and guide you to the appropriate session room. Students should get a name tag and print their first name on their name tag.

Students can join another session at any time.  Students 7 - 12 who are complete beginners are encouraged to join the Scratch group.  We encourage the parent and student to discuss and decided what session their student attends.  Talk to a mentor for advice on what session your student should attend.

## Online registraton for sessions

CoderDojo McDonough uses Meetup.com's RSVP system to reserve spaces for students at each sessions. For each session the parent should RSVP for their students. Visit our website and click the "RSVP for a session" link to reserve your student's spot for a session.  You will need to RSVP separately for all sessions you want your student to attend.

Parents should only RSVP for the number of students participating and do
not include parents or guardians. This will allow us to know how many students to allow based on our number of mentors.

Due to the high level of student interest, attendees who are not registered
on [our Meetup.com site](http://meetup.com/CoderDojoMcDonough) may not be allowed to sit in a session room with a mentor. Students who are not on our RSVP list will wait in a waiting area. If the room is full
to capacity with registered students, students not on the RSVP will be allowed to either move to another dojo session with availability
or students can sit in another area of the library and work on code learning websites with minimal help from a mentor. Mentors will work to ensure that all students in the library at least have access to a text editor or Scratch and ability to view learning material.  If a session room is not full with registered students when the dojo begins around 1:30pm, dojo coordinators will begin to allow waiting students to sit in the session room.

Mentors are encouraged to lead groups with no more than 8 students.  Having a limit on the number of students per mentor makes sure that students who register are able to receive adequate attention.

## Advanced Student Signup

We encourage intermediate or advanced students to register using our
Advanced Student Signup form at [http://www.coderdojohenry.com/AdvancedStudentSignup](http://www.coderdojohenry.com/AdvancedStudentSignup).  Intermediate students are students who understand the basics of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Scratch, or another programming language. Having more details about our intermediate students will allow the coordinators to match students with mentors.  All students must still RSVP for each session.  Students who register using our Advanced Student Signup form but do not RSVP for a session using our Meetup site may not be able to attend the session they want.

## Learning resources before your first session or in between sessions

Please see our **[Students getting started and online learning guide
](http://www.coderdojohenry.com/learning-guide)**. In it, you'll find lots of great free resources
that you
should study and practice with in your own time on the following
learning
tracks:

  * Scratch
  * HTML/CSS
  * JavaScript
 

You should start on one or more of these tracks so that you'll have good
questions and ideas for what you'd like to learn more about when you
visit the
dojo in person.

### Highly recommended

We highly encourage you to utilize the free lessons and projects on
**Codecademy** and **Learnstreet**, and other online resources.

# Have fun and learn a lot! Let us know how we're doing too!

We want you to have fun and learn lots of new things! We also love your
feedback and want to know what kinds of ideas you have and what you want
to learn, so let us know when you visit! Thanks!
