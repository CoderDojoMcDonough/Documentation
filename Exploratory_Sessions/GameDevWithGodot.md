## Game Development with Godot

The Godot game development platform uses a custom scripting language named GDScript, which is very similar to the Python programming language.  Students who are new to programming are encouraged to use Codecademy's Python course to begin learning Python: <http://codecademy.com/tracks/python>

Resources:
* [Godot game engine](http://www.godotengine.org/)
    We recommend students using a Windows laptop download godot_win32.exe (1.1 stable version) and godot_demos.zip files [here](http://www.godotengine.org/projects/godot-engine/documents)

* [Introduction to Programming](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9362458/CoderDojoMcDonough/coderdojo_learn.pdf) (PDF)
* [Game Development Learning Guide](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Software_Development)

* [Additonal Game Development Resource Links](Game%20Development%20Resources.md)

Requirements:
Godot is a free and open source game engine, so there are not costs assoicated with using Godot.  
Students will need to have a Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop.

## The Format

Before each session we will have the students download a demo project made with Godot. At the beginning of each section we will overview key programming concepts. During the session we will look at and modify the demo project, adding or removing features.
