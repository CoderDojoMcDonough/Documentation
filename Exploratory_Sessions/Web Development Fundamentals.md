We recommend using the [Brackets](http://brackets.io) text editor or [JSbin](http://jsbin.com/nurohudabe/edit?html,css,output)

**Setup Instructions**

1. Create a folder on your computer called `Blog`.
2. Create three files in the folder `index.html`, `style.css` and `script.js`.
3. Copy and paste the HTML from [here](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Programming-Language-Tutorials/blob/master/Web%20Development/projects/Blog/index.html) into `index.html` and the CSS from 
[here](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Programming-Language-Tutorials/blob/master/Web%20Development/projects/Blog/style.css) into `style.css`

**Try to:**

1. Change the image to an image of your own. Do a [Googe Images](https://images.google.com) search, right-click the image you want to use, and click `Copy Link Address`(in Google Chrome). In **Safari** it is `Copy Image Address` and in **Firefox** it is `Copy Link Location`.
2. Change the title's name to your name.
3. Adjust the size of the image
4. Change the `<h1>` tag color to a hex value from http://www.color-hex.com. Change it to an `rgb()` value.

**Edit a Webpage's css**

1. Right-click inside of any webpage and click `Inspect Element` to inspect the HTML and CSS of that webpage. You can target an item on a webpage by clicking the **target icon**. Try to adjust the color of some text on the page, or the size of an image on the page.
