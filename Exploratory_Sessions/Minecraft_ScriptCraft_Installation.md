##Quick installation instructions for ScriptCraft

We have created a zip file to help streamline the ScriptCraft installation process.  CoderDojo students with Windows laptops can use these instructions to install the Spigot server and ScriptCraft.

1.  [Click here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9362458/CoderDojoMcDonough/SpigotServer.zip) to download a zip file containing the Spigot server and ScriptCraft.  Unzip the file when the download is complete.

2.  Move the unzipped folder and create a desktop shortcut.  This step is optional.  Use File Explorer on Windows 8 (or Windows Explorer on Windows 7 and below) to move the unzipped ScriptCraft folder to the C drive of your computer or some other location on your disk.  You can also make a shortcut to the start.bat file on your Desktop so you can easily start the Spigot server in the future.

3.  Start the Spigot server.  Double-click on the file named "start.bat".  A command prompt window should open.  
  * If you see a message "Loading libraries, please wait..." followed by dozens of lines of more text saying things like "Preparing spawn area", the Spigot server is running properly so you can proceed to step the next step.
  * If you see the message "'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command", install Java from the http://www.java.com website.  If you have already performed that step and you are still seeing this error, Java will need to be added to your computer's path.  Adding Java to your computer's path is technically challenging... mentors at one of our coding sessions will be happy to help you with this task.  Instructons for adding Java to your classpath may be found here: http://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml

4.  In the Spigot command window type op {your_username} and hit enter, replacing {your_username} with your own minecraft username.  This will give you operator access which is necessary to run ScriptCraft.  The Spigot server keeps track of operators in a text file, so you do not need to perform this step every time you start the Spigot server.

5.  Follow the ["First Steps" section on the Young Person's Guide to Programming in Minecraft](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/docs/YoungPersonsGuideToProgrammingMinecraft.md#first-steps) to connect the CraftBukkit server you just finished setting up with your Minecraft game. 



Once you have successfully installed ScriptCraft, we recommend that you continue reading through [The Young Person's Guide to Programming in Minecraft]
(https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/docs/YoungPersonsGuideToProgrammingMinecraft.md#installation).
