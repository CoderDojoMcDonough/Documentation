## Game Development with Godot

The Godot game development platform uses a custom scripting language named GDScript, which is very similar to the Python programming language.  Students who are new to programming are encouraged to use Codecademy's Python course to begin learning Python: <http://codecademy.com/tracks/python>

Resources:
* [Godot game engine](http://www.godotengine.org/)
    We recommend students using a Windows laptop download the godot_win32.exe and godot_demos.zip files.

Requirements:
Godot is a free and open source game engine, so there are not costs assoicated with using Godot.  
Students will need to have a Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop.
