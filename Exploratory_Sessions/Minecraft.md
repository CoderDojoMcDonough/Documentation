## Minecraft Modding
Students interested in our Minecraft modding with JavaScript session should have a laptop with Minecraft installed and a Minecraft account.  The free 30-day demo Minecraft account cannot be used for this session. 

## LearnToMod
Starting in 2015, CoderDojo McDonough will be offering free use of the LearnToMod software!  The kind folks at LearnToMod have given us free access to the LearnToMod platform during our coding sessions.

LearnToMod has several benefits over using ScriptCraft and CanaryMod directly:
* Unlocking badges as you learn new concepts makes learning to build mods like a game itself.
* The guided lessons in LearnToMod cover a wide variety of programming concepts like loops, variables, and functions.
* Students use a drag and drop programming interface to program.  You can see the JavaScript generated by your drag and drop coding.
* The drag and drop programming style makes Minecraft modding much easier for younger students.
* No need to setup your own Minecraft server and deal with things like Java path issues.

Learn more about LearnToMod at http://www.learntomod.com/ .  Students will be able to access LearnToMod for free during our class.  Students who want to continue to use LearnToMod outside of our classes can signup for a paid LearnToMod.com account.

If any students want to continue with standard ScriptCraft without LearnToMod, that will be fine.  We encourage all students to try LearnToMod at least once to see how they like it.

## Minecraft Modding with JavaScript - for students not using LearnToMod
We strongly recommend that students in our Minecraft session learn JavaScript fundamentals using [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript).  The Web Development sessions at CoderDojo McDonough are a great way to get help from a mentor while learning the basics of JavaScript.  During our Minecraft modding sessions we will try to help reinforce a basic understanding of JavaScript, but students who have worked with JavaScript on their own will be able to pick up Minecraft modding with JavaScript faster.

## Installation

[Click here](Minecraft_ScriptCraft_Installation.md) to view our streamlined installation instructions for Windows users.  These steps were created using the installation instructions found in the Young Person's Guide link below, but they save parents or students from having to download separate jar files and create their own start.bat file.

Full instructions for installing and configuring ScriptCraft can be found in the [The Young Person’s Guide to Programming in Minecraft](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/docs/YoungPersonsGuideToProgrammingMinecraft.md#installation) - This guide contains details on how to start using JavaScript with Minecraft.

<!--
[Click here](Minecraft_ScriptCraft_Installation.md#run-craftbukkit-without-an-internet-connection) for instructions on running the CraftBukkit server without an internet connection.

If you see the error message "You don't have scriptcraft.evaluate permission” when using ScriptCraft in Minecraft, see step 4 in our streamlined [installation instructions](Minecraft_ScriptCraft_Installation.md).

## Set time and storm

I find it helpful to switch the time of day when it gets dark or turn off a storm...

change time of day to daytime:  
self.location.world.setTime(6000);

set storm:  
server.worlds.get(0).setStorm(false);
