#Web Browsers

##Note to parents / guardians:

While it would be preferable to have all students using the same web browser, such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/), in order to make it easier to spot problems and make sure everything works as expected, we understand that this is not always possible.

We do, however, ask that you help your student upgrade whichever browser they are using to the latest version if it's not already up to date.  In most cases, this won't be necessary as the four major modern browsers should now all automatically update themselves to save you the trouble.

###Instructions for updating browsers:

* [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?hl=en)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version)
* [Microsoft Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie)
* [Apple Safari](http://www.apple.com/softwareupdate/) (Also available through the App Store)

###Official Browser Homepages:

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
* [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
* [Microsoft Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie)
* [Apple Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)
