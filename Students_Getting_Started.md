start on these even before you attend your first dojo, to see what inspires you and what you want to get
help with.**

## Scratch

Scratch is a great way to learn programming concepts, especially for children 7 - 10 who do not type well.  Scratch uses a graphical programming interface instead of typing.  Find out more and create an account at [http://scratch.mit.edu/](http://scratch.mit.edu/)



# More resources

Code.org keeps a good "jumping off" point for online learning [right here](http://www.code.org/learn).

# And even more!

You are not limited to learning these languages in our dojo! It's just that, so far, this is what most students 
have expressed interest in, and what most mentors have experience with. If you have other goals and ideas, just 
let us know and we'll do our best to help you get started or take what you've already done even further.

And, if you find other great online resources, let us know!
